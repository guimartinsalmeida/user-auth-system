# User Auth Simple Platform
This project aims to create a simple authentication system using Node.js and Express. The system allows for user creation, login, updating, and deletion, as well as authentication via JSON Web Token (JWT). The application includes basic frontend functionality for testing, but the main interaction happens via backend and tools like Postman.
